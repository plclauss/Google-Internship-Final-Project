# Google-Internship-Final-Project
Closing of Google's CSSI (July 2020) - Final Project

In July of 2020, I attended Google's Computer Science Summer Institute (CSSI). It was an unpaid, virtual internship where interns were taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
At the end of the month-long program, interns were placed in small groups of 5 or less and were told to create a project using everything we had learned throughout the internship.
My team created a form of retro Donkey-Kong, which was to be presented to the instructors and other members in our cohort, again, at the end of the month-long internship.
